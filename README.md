# C-Big-Integer-Library
C++ Big Integer library for programming contests and medium scale computations

What is included:

Basic integer operations:
- Addition and subtraction of two numbers in O(N + M) time
- Multiplication of two numbers in O(max(N, M)^1.58) time using Karatsuba's algorithm
- Division and modulo of two numbers in O(N * M) time
- Conversion of data types, manipulations on integers

Extra:
- Bitwise operations: and/or/xor/not/...
- Binary shifts
- Math functions:
    min/max operators
    square root calculation in O(N^(1 + 1.58)) using binary search (other faster methods can be used here)
    cube root calculation
    large factorials, checking if a number is a factorial of some nonnegative integer
- Generation of random integers in particular range and length

- Primes
    primality check
    Fermat witness method for pseudoprime numbers
    generation of random numbers in particular range
